- Do not use as a replacement but as an [add-on](/alt-pages.html).

- This approach is particularly useful for common elements like images.
  - This functionality however, could be replicated on the main site to enhance a more bespoke 
  and open UX.

- Use Google analytics to identify pages to build an [add-on template](/alt-pages.html) for.

- Choose a suitable AMP component to replicate its counterpart on the main site.
  
- Establish an understanding of the differences with site owners.

- Implement with a very strict structure, only adding what is required.
  - This will require special attention within any CMS or other system.

- Get better at improving page speeds regardless!
  - Google only created AMP because tools like [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google
  .com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) have been largely ignored.
  - Don't use badly made front end components, usually from modules that are years old.
  - Some state that Google are trying to improve things though hard to understand why they would 
  create new tag elements.
