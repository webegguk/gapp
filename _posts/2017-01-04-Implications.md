- If using to replace sites it'll be a big change and learning curve.
  - Would mean more to learn for new projects and implications of merging into existing templates.
  - Would suggest there are few 'modules' for software systems that cover setup of modules.

- If using to partly replace (ie mobile version only), it'll impact any build process.
  - Makes no sense in giving any attention to mobile versions of responsive sites.
  
- If using as add-on it would mean extra work on top of existing.
  - Makes the most sense as it would mean no change to the main site was required.
  
- Whichever method is adopted, Sass structure would need attention.
  - You can't dump all css for whole site into the inline css for particular AMP pages.
